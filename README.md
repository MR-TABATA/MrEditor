# MrEditor

**English** | [日本語](README.ja.md)

**A Mac-native viewer — and editor — for 10 GB text files.**

Open a 10 GB log — **86,420,337 lines** — and it starts displaying in **~80 ms**. The file is
mapped, never copied: with all 10 GB open, `vmmap` reports **0 bytes dirty** for it. Jumping to
the last line takes **0.1 ms**. As of **v0.4** you can also **edit and save** — at any size,
with atomic writes.

> It started life as a fast **read-only** viewer (full-file search, filtered view / live grep,
> `tail -f`). **v0.4 makes the name literal**: it edits and saves too.

![Opening a 10 GB, 86,420,337-line log in MrEditor — it paints immediately, and the line index keeps building in the background](docs/img/10gb-open.gif)

*The first 10 seconds of a single uncut take, at real speed: the 10.00 GB file opens, and we scroll it while the line index is still building. Watch the status bar — the line count is an estimate until the index lands (9.1 s), then it settles at the exact **86,420,337**. The view never blocks; you can read, search and edit throughout. [The whole 27-second take, uncut, ending with ⌘L to the last line.](docs/media/mreditor-10gb.mp4)*

## Why

The usual answer on macOS is `NSTextView`, but it keeps the whole document in
`NSTextStorage`. Hand it 10 GB and it falls over. MrEditor takes the large-log-viewer
approach (klogg / glogg / lnav):

- **mmap** the file — never load the whole thing into memory.
- Keep a **sparse line index** (line number + byte offset every 2,000 lines → 670 KB for this file, ~800 KB for 100 M lines).
- **Draw only the visible lines** with Core Text, on a fixed-size view driven by a custom
  line-unit `NSScroller` (so we never build a 1.6-billion-point document view that would
  blow past float precision).

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE_v0.1.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_v0.1.md) for the full design.

## Features (1.2)

**Viewing**
- Opens arbitrarily large text files (validated at 10 GB) with near-instant first paint.
- Automatic encoding detection: **UTF-8 / Shift-JIS / EUC-JP** (verified on real files).
- Custom line-unit scroller and keyboard navigation (arrows, page, home/end).
- **Go to line (⌘L)** and **adjustable font size (⌘+ / ⌘- / ⌘0)** — persisted across launches.
- **Follow mode (`tail -f`, ⌥⌘F)** — auto-scrolls as the file grows; the index extends incrementally.
- Copy the visible range (⌘C). Status bar: encoding, line count, file size, indexing progress.

**Editing (new in v0.4)**
- **Edit and save files of any size** — small files load into an `NSTextView`; large files edit
  through a **piece table** over the mmap, so even a huge log stays responsive while you type.
- **Atomic save** — writes to a temporary file and swaps it in, so the original is never left half-written.
- **Choose the save encoding** — convert between **UTF-8 / Shift-JIS / EUC-JP**; line endings are
  normalized to the file's own EOL (LF / CRLF).
- New (⌘N), Save (⌘S), Save As (⌘⇧S), and Revert to saved.

**Workspace**
- Open **multiple files at once** and switch between them from a **sidebar** list.
- **Close from the sidebar** — each row has a close (×) button; **unsaved documents are color-coded**.
- **Session restore (new in v0.7)** — your sidebar comes back on launch (order and active tab
  included; files that vanished are skipped). **Unsaved new documents are restored with their text**,
  so quitting never nags you to save a scratch tab (unsaved edits to *saved* files are still confirmed).
- **Recent files** (File ▸ Open Recent).
- Drag a file onto the window to open it.
- **Finder integration (new in v0.8)** — MrEditor appears in Finder's *Open With* for `.log`,
  `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json` and friends. It never steals the default app.
- **Print & PDF export (new in v0.8)** — File ▸ Print… (⌘P). The print dialog's
  *PDF ▸ Save as PDF* gives you a PDF. Disabled for huge files (millions of pages).
- **Update check (new in v0.8)** — tells you when a newer version ships (on launch, once a day).
  It never replaces anything; it just opens the download page. Turn it off in Preferences ▸ General.

**Customization (new in v0.5)**
- **Fonts** — pick any monospaced family and size (Preferences ▸ Display), persisted across launches.
- **Display** — tab width (2/4/8), line spacing, current-line highlight, caret shape (bar / block / underline), and soft-wrap.
- **Color themes** — System (auto light/dark), Solarized Dark / Light, Monokai, or fully custom colors — applied to
  the text **and** the surrounding UI (sidebar, gutter, status bar, title bar).

**Search** (⌘F) — streams over the mmap, never loads the file
- Instant highlight of matches in the visible lines, plus a background full-file scan
  with an exact match count (capped at 1,000,000 matching lines).
- **Multi-term AND** (space-separated), **regular expressions** (`.*` toggle), and a **case-sensitive** toggle.
- Find next / previous, jumping to each matching line.
- **Filtered view / live grep** — show only matching lines, keeping their real line numbers.

**Compare / diff (new in v1.1)** — View ▸ Compare (Diff)
- Four ways in: **two files** (⇧⌘D), **two open documents** (unsaved text included — it compares what you see), **against the clipboard**, or **against a URL** (https — paste a link and it diffs what the web returns against what you have open).
- Side by side, with additions, deletions and changes colored. **Changed lines get a character-level diff**, so a single `status=200` → `500` stands out.
- **⇧⌘] / ⇧⌘[** for next / previous difference. The **scrollbar shows where the differences are**, so you can see at a glance which parts of a million-line file moved.
- Select within a column and **⌘C** to copy (rows that exist only on the other side are never mixed in).
- **Merge (new in v1.2)** — **click the → beside a difference** and the left side's version lands in the right, immediately (click again to undo; ⌥→ / ⌥← also work).
  The arrow means what it says: **the right side is what changes**. Write that result out with **View ▸ Compare (Diff) ▸ Save Merged Result As…**.
  **The two original files are never touched.** Push nothing across, and you get the right file back byte for byte.
- Diffing needs a 16-byte index per line — unlike viewing, that is real memory. Files too large for
  your machine are **refused with a reason**, never silently killed. Measured: 1 GB × 2 (8.7 M lines) in 5.4 s, 1.7 GB.

**Structured view (new in v0.6)** — read-only, toggled from View ▸ Structured View
- **CSV / TSV** aligned into monospaced columns; **NDJSON** projected into columns by key.
- **JSON** pretty-printed with indentation (new in 1.4) — key order and number formatting preserved,
  since it re-indents the original text rather than re-serializing.
- Column widths are fixed from a sample of the file, so **millions of rows format instantly** and
  don't jitter while scrolling. **East-Asian-width aware** — full-width Japanese columns line up.
- Purely a display transform: it never modifies the file (saving keeps the original CSV/JSON), and a
  banner with a **Back to raw text** button is shown while it's on.

**JSON query (new in 1.4)** — View ▸ JSON Query… (⌥⌘J), on a JSON document
- Type a **jmespath-style expression** and the view is replaced by the result, live: fields and dotted
  paths (`a.b.c`), array indexes (`items[0]`, `items[-1]`), wildcard projection (`items[*].name`,
  `m.*`), and filters (`items[?age >= 30].name`, comparators `== != < <= > >=`).
- **Volatile and read-only**: the result is never saved; close the bar (Esc) to return to the original.
  Best for config and API-response JSON (small files); large logs use NDJSON above.

**Text toolbox (new in 1.5)** — the **Format** menu, acting on the current selection (one undo each)
- **Case**: UPPER / lower / Title Case / tOGGLE cASE.
- **Encode / decode**: URL, Base64, and HTML entities (decoders leave invalid input untouched).
- **Line ops**: sort (ascending / descending), remove duplicate lines (keeps first-seen order),
  reverse, and number lines.
- **Filter Through Command… (⌥⌘R)**: pipe the selection through any shell command — `jq .`,
  `sort`, `sed 's/a/b/g'` — and replace it with the output. Runs off the main thread with a timeout.
- Works in **both panes**, so line ops and filters run on a selection inside a 10 GB file too.

UI **localized in English and Japanese**.

## Install

Download `MrEditor-<version>.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases), open it, and drag
**MrEditor** to Applications.

**Runs on both Apple Silicon and Intel** (universal build).

**As of v0.9 the app is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple.**
No right-click, no `xattr` — just double-click it.

Or just build from source (below).

## Build & run

Requires macOS 13+ and a Swift toolchain (Xcode 15+).

```sh
swift build
sh scripts/make_app.sh debug          # wrap the binary into MrEditor.app
open .build/MrEditor.app --args "/path/to/big.log"
```

Generate test data (the `testdata/` dir is git-ignored):

```sh
python3 scripts/gen_testdata.py --encoding-set --out-dir testdata/   # UTF-8 / SJIS / EUC samples
python3 scripts/gen_testdata.py --size 10G --jp --out testdata/test_10gb.log
```

Build a distributable disk image (`.build/MrEditor-1.5.dmg`):

```sh
sh scripts/make_dmg.sh
```

## Performance (measured 2026-07-15, 10.00 GB / 86,420,337 lines, Japanese UTF-8)

Measured on the shipping 1.3 build (`swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64`), Apple Silicon. 1.4 only adds small-file JSON handling and does not touch these paths, so these numbers stand.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Time to first paint | 55–90 ms |
| Full background index | 9.3–10.2 s (does not block display) |
| Seek to last line | 0.1 ms |
| The file's own pages | 4–6 GB resident (varies run to run), **0 bytes dirty** |
| App physical footprint | ~130 MB — about the same with nothing open |

The last two rows are the honest picture, so read them together. The 10 GB you opened costs
nothing: it is mapped, not copied, and `vmmap` attributes **0 dirty bytes** to it — the resident
pages are file-backed and the OS can drop them whenever it likes. The app's own ~130 MB is window
backing store and the kernel page tables for a 10 GB mapping; it barely moves whether the file is
open or not, and none of it is your log. `ps` RSS reads several GB during indexing for the same
reason, and means just as little.

Reproduce it yourself:

```sh
MREDITOR_TIMING=1 .build/MrEditor.app/Contents/MacOS/MrEditor testdata/test_10gb.log
# → first paint: 73.9 ms
# → index complete: 9.79 s (86420337 lines)

vmmap $(pgrep -x MrEditor) | grep test_10gb.log     # → 10.0G  5.6G  0K  (vsize resident dirty; resident varies, dirty stays 0)
```

## Roadmap

- **v0.1 — viewer** ✅
- **v0.2 — search, multi-term AND, regex, filtered view (live grep), `tail -f`, copy** ✅
- **v0.3 — multiple documents + sidebar, go to line, font zoom, recent files, case-sensitive search** ✅
- **v0.4 — editing & saving (any size), atomic writes, encoding conversion, EOL handling, new/save/save-as/revert** ✅
- **v0.5 — customization: font selection, display settings, color themes (editor + UI), sidebar close & unsaved markers** ✅
- **v0.6 — structured view: CSV/TSV column alignment & NDJSON field projection (read-only, any size)** ✅
- **v0.7 — session restore (unsaved drafts included), About panel fix** ✅
- **v0.8 — Finder integration, print/PDF export, update check, new icon, universal build, and a critical distribution fix (below)** ✅
- **v0.9 — signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple; opens with a plain double-click** ✅
- **1.0 — the milestone: open and edit 10 GB files on a Mac, signed and notarized, opens with a double-click** ✅
- **1.0.1 — fixes data loss: an unsaved new document vanished when the app was launched by opening a file** ✅
- **1.0.2 — unsaved text is kept as its own draft file, written as you type: it survives a crash or force quit** ✅
- **1.0.3 — Go to line (⌘L) no longer fails silently when a Japanese IME is active** ✅
- **1.1 — Compare (diff): two files, two open documents, or against the clipboard — side by side, down to the characters that changed** ✅
- **1.1.1 — Compare Two Files now asks for one file, then the other. Before, it silently did nothing unless you ⌘-clicked both at once** ✅
- **1.2 — Merge: click the arrow next to a difference to pull it across, then save the result under a new name. The two originals are never touched** ✅
- **1.2.1 — Merge now follows the arrow: → pushes the left side into the right, and the right pane changes as you click. Before, it only remembered your choice and nothing moved on screen** ✅
- **1.3 — Compare with a URL (https): paste a link and it diffs what the web returns against the document you have open — a fourth way in, alongside two files, two open documents and the clipboard** ✅
- **1.4 — JSON: pretty-print a document from Structured View, and query it in place with a jmespath-style expression (⌥⌘J) — filter and project without touching the file** ✅
- **1.5 — Text toolbox (Format menu): case conversion, URL/Base64/HTML encode-decode, sort/dedupe/reverse/number lines, and Filter Through Command (⌥⌘R) to pipe a selection through any shell command — in both panes, so it works inside a 10 GB file too** ✅ (this release)
- **later** — syntax/log highlighting, and more analysis tooling

> **⚠️ Builds up to v0.7 do not launch on a Mac that downloaded them.**
> The `.app` bundle was never code-signed, so its signature seal was inconsistent and
> macOS killed the quarantined app on launch ("quit unexpectedly").
> **Fixed in v0.8.** The build is now **universal (Apple Silicon & Intel)** as well —
> previously it was arm64-only.
>
> **v0.8 launches, but needs a right-click → Open on the first run** (it is only ad-hoc signed).
> **v0.9 and later are signed and notarized, so even that is unnecessary.**

## Not yet

Syntax / log highlighting and deeper analysis tooling. Editing landed in **v0.4** — the piece-table
design keeps even a 10 GB file editable without giving up the fast, low-memory open that MrEditor
is built around.

## Contributing

Bug fixes, performance, viewing/editing/search improvements, and translations are welcome — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The core is a fast viewer/editor for huge files; heavier
automation and analysis tooling are out of scope (it's open-core — fork freely).
